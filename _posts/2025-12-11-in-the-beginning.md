Ever since getting into coding post-college, I've dabbled in personal projects, but they've pretty much always been just that, _personal_. I've shared a little bit on Facebook and LinkedIn and such and written a few articles for other publications, but I figure it's time to actually have a place of my own where I can post a bit more formally about what I've been working on and/or thinking about. I don't expect to follow any particular publishing cadence, but maybe having this site will encourage me to be a bit more deliberate about things. (That's got to be good for professional development too, right?)

I have a lot of ideas that have been banging around my head for a while in various states of progress, but I expect that my primary topics will be related to things like home automation, Arduino, Rust, Python, computer vision, and recreational math. Depending on how I want to present myself (and consent from my wife), there may be some space for more analog topics, like travel or athletic misadventures, as well. My hope is that this might be at least a fraction as useful to you as many other bloggers, educators, and storytellers that I've encountered online have been to me. Let's get started.
